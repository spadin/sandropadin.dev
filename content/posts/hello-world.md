Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post using Hugo and the PaperMod theme.

## Getting Started

Hugo makes it incredibly easy to create and manage a static blog. Here's a simple code example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Hugo!")
}
```

## Why Hugo?

- **Fast**: Hugo builds sites in milliseconds
- **Flexible**: Extensive theming and templating options
- **Simple**: Easy to learn and use

Stay tuned for more posts!
